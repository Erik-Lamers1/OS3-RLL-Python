This repo is a Python(3) implementation of the original [OS3 Rocket League Ladder](https://github.com/Erik-Lamers1/OS3-Rocket-League-Ladder) written in PHP.

This implementation makes heavy use of the [Python discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
The idea is that players participating in the ladder can control the challenges and result entirely from discord.

mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3.8) -a $(pwd) OS3-RLL-Python
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
pre-commit install
# And you are good to go
```

## Running the tests
